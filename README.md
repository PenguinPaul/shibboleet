MyBB XKCD/806 Compliance plugin
===============================

This plugin will draw attention to threads that contain the word "shibboleet" so that presumably someone who knows at least two programming languages will answer it.  If you have no clue why you would want this, see the xkcd comic below.



This plugin requires MySupport (as of right now, see below for more info).  If can be downloaded here: http://mods.mybb.com/view/mysupport or https://github.com/MattRogowski/MySupport

Todo
====
Add support for other systems beyond using MySupport, like PM'ing certain members who know at least two programming languages upon thread creation.
